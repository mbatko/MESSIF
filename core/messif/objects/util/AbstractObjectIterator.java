/**
 * Implementation of an iterator over a collection of {@link AbstractObject abstract objects}.
 * It provides methods for getting objects by their position, ID, data-equality, locator or
 * {@link ObjectMatcher}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All methods are implemented in a "stream" fashion, i.e.
 * only the {@link #next()} method is used to accomplish all the getting methods.
 * Note that iterator cannot go back, so for example the {@link #getObjectByID(messif.objects.UniqueID) get-by-id}
 * method will only find the object if it has not been skipped in the iterator before.
