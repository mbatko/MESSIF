/**
 * The component responsible for sending and receiving messages.
 * This dispatcher registers to a TCP/UDP port (as specified in constructor)
 * and possibly also to a multicast group on a specified UDP port.
 * Using the local host IP address, the {@link NetworkNode}
 * identifier is created.
 *
 * <p>
 * After the initialization, messages can be sent to another host, where
 * the {@link MessageDispatcher} is running using {@link #sendMessage sendMessage} method.
 * This method sends a {@link Message} to the destination {@link MessageDispatcher}, addressed
 * by its {@link NetworkNode}.<br/>
 * If a multicast group has been initialized, it is also possible to send a message
 * to all participants, i.e. no destination is given.
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to wait for a {@link ReplyMessage}, i.e. we expect another message to return
 * in response to a message sent by us. This can be done through {@link #sendMessageWaitReply sendMessageWaitReply}
 * method, which returns an instance of {@link ReplyReceiver} associated with the sent message - see its
 * documentation for detailed info on how to get the received reply messages.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The waiting mechanism allows also more complex scenarios, when multiple hosts are involved:<br/>
 * <img src="messif-network-messaging.png" alt="MESSIF network messaging example" /><br/>
 * The method that waits for results ensures the completeness of the answer, even if the message was
 * sent to several network nodes that forward it (either replying or not) to another network nodes and even
 * if the message pathes contain cycles.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * On the other hand, the dispatcher allows to receive messages. The replies are received and passed to
 * an associated ReplyReceiver automatically. For normal messages, we can register a message {@link Receiver receiver}.
 * Once a message is received on any socket, it is passed to every registered receiver through its
 * {@link Receiver#acceptMessage acceptMessage} until <tt>true</tt> is returned. Thus the first
 * receiver, that accepts the message stops the traversal. If there is no receiver that accepts the provided
 * message, a warning is logged.
 * </p>
