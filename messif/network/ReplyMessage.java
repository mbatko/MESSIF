/**
 * The ancestor of all reply messages that are returned back during communication with other network nodes.
 * The reply message is alwas a reply for some other message and it inherits the message ID and all
 * the navigation path from the original message. Specifically, the reply message is a continuation
 * of an existing message that can be sent back to a waiting node. Only ReplyMessage can be returned from
 * {@link ReplyReceiver}, thus whenever we want to inform the original node about our findings, we must transform
 * the "forward" message with the ReplyMessage.
